      <h3>How the Industry is Responding to Today</h3>
      <p>
        At the start of 2020, the real estate market was as healthy as it had ever been. That is, until COVID-19 disrupted the global economy. From lockdowns to safety concerns, real estate professionals have had to adapt to new challenges that have altered how they do business. As the industry looks to find a path forward, we partnered with The Wall Street Journal to survey readers and gain insights into their concerns and questions as buyers and sellers. Those findings, paired with the experiences of our Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices network professionals, offer actionable observations and thoughtful direction on where the industry can go next.
